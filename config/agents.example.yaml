# ARC Agent Registry Configuration
# ==================================
# Defines all agents in the multi-agent system.
#
# Each agent has:
# - id: Unique identifier
# - role: Agent role type
# - model: LLM model to use
# - priority: Priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
# - capabilities: List of capabilities
# - voting_weight: Weight in consensus votes (higher = more influence)
# - offline: Whether agent can operate offline

# === AGENT ROLE DESCRIPTIONS ===
#
# director: Sets research strategy, mode, and novelty budgets
